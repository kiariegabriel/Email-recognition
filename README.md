# Email-recognition
Student email addresses end with @student.college.edu, while professor email addresses end with @prof.college.edu. This program first asks the user how many email addresses they will be entering, and then has the user enter those addresses. After all the email addresses are entered, the program should print out a message indicating either that all the addresses are student addresses or that there were some professor addresses entered.
